			 <p>As more and more people seem to be blindly accepting that AI belongs everywhere, whether it makes any sense or not, I think it’s important to demystify AI more and talk about the people trying to push for this future. Who does it actually benefit? What do they value? Why are we just going along with it?</p>
<p>This is a great interview and a very revealing conversation about the company behind some of the most popular AI products today. If you use AI tools, you should understand where (and who) they come from before you make them an indispensable part of how you work and think.</p>

<p>Imagine if we eliminated the middle-man and artists didn’t need to beg for money on Patreon and justify the (commercial) value of their work.</p>
<p>We should all want to cultivate a rich culture. Arts funding should go hand-in-hand with science funding. We can’t say what the tangible benefits of space exploration or creative exploration will be but they both can yield results nobody could plan for.</p>

<p>AI will outpace humans in all structured tasks. If you’re producing repeatable deliverables, you will be automated.</p>

</ul>
<p>I don’t disagree with this take, but I do wonder if anyone willingly finds themself in the “repeatable deliverables” situation of their own volition.</p>
<p>I do a lot of the same things in my work, but over-optimizing a system and doing things exactly the same way every day becomes so boring and soulless. I’m constantly re-working how I arrive at a finished product and that in turn refines what I make (the quality and the process and experience of the making).</p>
<p>Before factories and mass-production and Taylorism, things were much more freeform. Craftspeople built their own tools and constantly reimagined what they did. Art and “production” are only different when someone else is forcing you to produce repetitively and in a standardized way. That’s where you become replaceable: when you’re just a stand-in for a machine.</p>
<p>As with so many other issues, is AI showing us where we need to pivot in order to stay relevant or is it revealing to us where the exploitation and power structures already are in our society?</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m a slow reader and I often lose interest in reading <em>in general</em> for months at a time. I also really <em>value</em> reading and I feel better when I do it than when I don&rsquo;t for months at a time.</p>
<p>At the start of 2024 I set a modest goal for myself to, by the end of the year, have read a book a month (on average). So, twelve books in twelve months. I know that&rsquo;s not very much for some, including past versions of myself, but it felt like something I could manage or even exceed.</p>
<p>And I <em>did</em> manage <em>and</em> exceed it. Wrapping up the year, I&rsquo;ve read (or listened to) 13 books. I also started taking more deliberate notes while reading, and so I thought it would be fun to review to books I read and give some thoughts on them.</p>
<p>I also, part way through the year, set a secondary goal for myself. I started to realize that the books I read are <em>mostly</em> written by men. I also got to enjoy the continued revelation that a <em>lot</em> of men - especially, it seems, famous and/or powerful men - turn out to be pretty awful people. I don&rsquo;t believe in separating the art from the artist - I&rsquo;ll write about that at some point - nor do I believe in throwing out people or art because we disapprove of them. However, I <em>also</em> believe that art and <em>especially</em> writing has the power to shape who you are and how you think, and I don&rsquo;t <em>love</em> the idea that I&rsquo;m - consciously or not - selecting from only half of humans, with higher odds of being <em>bad</em> humans, to read and shape the way I think. So my secondary goal was to have at least <em>half</em> the books I read this year be authored by women (or, not men, more specifically). I&rsquo;m happy to say that I did accomplish that goal, too, and that most of my favourite books I read this year were those women-authored works. Pretty neat!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go through these in chronological order of when I read them. I&rsquo;ll link where you can find each book, as well, if you&rsquo;d like to read them, too. I recommend everything I read this year, since I usually make sure I&rsquo;ll like books before I commit to them and so rarely read through books I dislike.</p>

<p>Incidentally, it is what set later industrial revolutions turning, too. As David Noble, a historian of 20th century automation wrote:
“Managers feel they must automate because ‘everyone’s doing it.’ Out of fear that they will be undone by more up-to-date competitors — a paranoia encouraged by equipment vendors. There is this vague belief that the drive to automate is inevitable, unavoidable, and this belief becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is my rollover book from 2023. I <em>technically</em> read most of it leading up to the end of the year, but I finished it in January and it had such an impact on my thinking this year that it feels appropriate to kick off this list. I also <em>listened</em> to this book, and I recommend the audio version read by Eric Jason Martin (linked above).</p>
<p>What can I say about this book? It&rsquo;s one of the most important historical books of our era, I think. We&rsquo;re living in a time when industrialisation and capitalism is running rampant on the globe and <em>technology</em> is being deified and literally evangelized as the upcoming incarnation of god-like power brought to earth. We&rsquo;re facing economic, ethical and environmental crises that are being <em>directly</em> caused by capitalists and their machines and the crazy thing about it is that <em>this has all happened before.</em> <em>Blood in the Machine</em> is the story of the Luddite uprising of the nineteenth century. It&rsquo;s a challenge against our popular understanding of the word &ldquo;Luddite&rdquo; and it is both a warning and a call to action.</p>
<p>I could probably go on to write many essays (and likely will) about 21st century Luddism and why we need to embrace and uphold the values of the Luddites in our struggles today. I&rsquo;ll leave it here by saying that if you use technology in your work in <em>any way</em> (and you almost certainly do), then you owe it to yourself and your comrades to read this book and to let the voice of Ned Ludd into your heart. I don&rsquo;t imagine we&rsquo;ve seen the end of machine breaking for the working class, and it&rsquo;s important we remember what that represents and understand which side we&rsquo;re on.</p>

<p>The national quest to modernize and mobilize entails a faith in one&rsquo;s ability to control world order, and when that happens, you lose your connection with the gods. When man begins to think that he is responsible for writing the script of the world, he forgets the forces that dream up our reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like going into books knowing that they&rsquo;re good - that they won&rsquo;t be a waste of my time or that I&rsquo;ll lose interest quickly - but I <em>also</em> like going into books knowing little about their plot. I&rsquo;ll take a recommendation and then dive in without reading the back of the book. That was what I did with <em>The Poppy War.</em> I can&rsquo;t even remember where the recommendation came from, but it had been sitting in my &ldquo;To Read&rdquo; list and came up on my library hold list and I decided to give it a go.</p>
<p>I <em>really</em> enjoyed aspects of this book, and also found parts of it a bit clumsy or tough to get through. In a funny way, though, I really enjoyed how imperfect it was. It was probably a bit too long, and it had a kind of brutality to it that felt gratuitous at times, but it felt like a very well executed <em>vision.</em> I think what I learned from this book is that, what I enjoy most in a work of art is when I can detect the artists intent and feel like they&rsquo;re mostly <em>nailing</em> what they wanted to do - even if it isn&rsquo;t entirely what I would have done or isn&rsquo;t working for me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to recap the plot or say much more about the book, honestly. If you enjoy fantasy novels or martial arts movies, this is probably something you&rsquo;ll enjoy. Just&hellip; be ready for things to be pretty grim.</p>

<p>That would be enough for some. But on the rare occasion when he actually cared, Bast found success as dull as ditchwater. Let others settle for mere excellence. Bast was an artist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t read <em>The Name of the Wind</em> or any of Patrick Rothfuss' following work, then this probably isn&rsquo;t a great place to start. But what I love about this book is just how little it matters to the fantasy universe of which it is a part. It makes me appreciate just how much thought and care an author can put into characters and symbols in order to tell simple stories about our lives and our experience. In a world full of spin-offs and reboots, it feels weird to have loved a book that deepens fantasy lore as much as I loved this book, and in a way that&rsquo;s because it <em>actually</em> deepens it, and doesn&rsquo;t just widen it.</p>
<p>As the years drag on, I find I care less and less if Patrick Rothfuss &ldquo;finishes&rdquo; his trilogy of fantasy novels. While others are loathe to even <em>start</em> reading <em>The Name of the Wind</em> until they know it has a satisfying ending, I get to enjoy the words that have actually been written. I don&rsquo;t know what people hope for when they say they&rsquo;re waiting for a series to be &ldquo;complete&rdquo; before they begin it&hellip; you know you could die any day, right? That likely won&rsquo;t be a satisfying ending either.</p>
<p><em>The Narrow Road Between Desires</em> is a wonderful little detour in the world of <em>The Kingkiller Chronicles</em> and I hope it was a cathartic process for Patrick Rothfuss, who doesn&rsquo;t owe us anything.</p>

<p>Jake has always mistrusted the expression &ldquo;knowing your roots.&rdquo; As though roots by their very definition are knowable. Any dendrologist can tell you that the roots of a mature Douglas fir forest spread for miles. That they&rsquo;re dark and intertwining, tangled and twisted, and impossible to map. That they often fuse together, and even communicate, secretly sharing nutrients and chemical weapons among themselves. So the truth is that there exists no clear distinction between one tree and another. And their roots are anything but knowable.</p>

<p><em>Greenwood</em> is another one of these books that I dove into without really knowing anything about it. It made a bad first impression, honestly, with a near-future dystopian setting and somewhat sarcastic protagonist that felt <em>just</em> a bit too much like I was reading an Andy Weir novel. All of that fell away quickly, though, and this became one of the most engaging books I&rsquo;ve ever read. I can&rsquo;t really overstate it. Reading this felt like I lived a dozen lives and it gave me a sense of connection to my ancestors and to nature that I really cherished.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t much more I can say. I can&rsquo;t recommend <em>Greenwood</em> enough. It&rsquo;s a really good book.</p>

<p>Whatever it is, the job is already better than her last five LinkedIn updates. Most of that work happened in mills: old mill yards, old gristmills, old leather mills, old textile mills. Sometimes they were called that. Woollen Mills was one of her old offices but abstracted from its original purpose in time and determination&hellip;
&hellip;Her temporary coworker at a 3D-printing start-up in Lawrence casually mentioned to her that the Bread and Roses Strike happened at that mill more than a hundred years ago. She never saw him again after that. His contract must have ended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I read that excerpt of <em>Wrong Way</em> while I ate my lunch at my desk in The Cotton Factory, a converted textile mill in the industrial sector of Hamilton, Ontario. That&rsquo;s when I realized that Joanne McNeil saw the truth about the world in a really honest, clear and oddly objective fashion.</p>
<p><em>Wrong Way</em> is probably the best &ldquo;dystopian future&rdquo; sci-fi book ever written, and it barely takes place in the future. It&rsquo;s about not-impossible technology, labour, the gig-economy and companies take advantage of how detached we are from one another. Its a book about how we&rsquo;re all being exploited by companies that we support, and how that&rsquo;s kind of okay because we all need to eat, don&rsquo;t we? It&rsquo;s so scathing and simultaneously completely non-judgemental. It&rsquo;s not really like any other book I&rsquo;ve read and I loved every page of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense of unreality to the book, like we&rsquo;re drifting through a dream, but at the same time the story is incredibly grounded and relatable. It&rsquo;s a funny contrast, and it reminds me of how the days can sort of fall away without much significance when all you&rsquo;re doing is working. <em>Wrong Way</em> asks where your body ends and your work begins, and it often seems to imply that that boundary is mostly imaginary if you let it be - and that&rsquo;s exactly what corporations want from us.</p>
<p>If <em>Blood in the Machine</em> is a loud, direct Luddite call to action, then <em>Wrong Way</em> is a Luddite nightmare that we&rsquo;re all quietly living and might never realize we can wake up from, if we even can at all.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t read a lot of memoirs, but I read this one because it paralleled the experience my partner had of getting an adult autism diagnosis. Fern Brady is a comedian who we watched on the <em>wonderful</em> British show <em>Taskmaster,</em> and who we&rsquo;d later see live in Toronto. Her memoir takes the approach of sort of retracing her life with the hindsight of her autism diagnosis, and sprinkles a good amount of education on the history of the treatment of and more of the lived experience of autistic people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a quick read, like many memoirs of relatively young people, but its a lot more informative and engaging. As a late-diagnosed ADHDer, I appreciated the effort that this book represents to turn a memoir into more of a PSA or informative device to help us recognize and support neurodivergent people <em>before</em> their lives become full of avoidable trauma and baggage. Maybe the next generation will have a bit of a better chance, right?</p>

<p>I think I came across this book in a Reddit thread recommending horror books or something. It sat in my &ldquo;To Read&rdquo; list for some time, until I decided I wanted to read something spooky and ordered a copy. It wasn&rsquo;t until I was about halfway through that I realized it was self-published, which is pretty impressive considering how fucking good this book is (which isn&rsquo;t to say that self-published books are all <em>bad</em>, but more so that I&rsquo;m surprised a publisher hadn&rsquo;t managed to scoop up a book of this quality).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been primed to like this book after spending a great many hours consumed by the <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> games. I don&rsquo;t really know why, but I&rsquo;m very compelled by medieval horror - especially if it blends cosmic horror with biblical fantasy. I&rsquo;m not religious, and I have yet to have dug much into actual medieval history, but a knight fighting a supernatural horror from some kind of hellish dimension sounds really cool to me.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s basically why I loved <em>Between Two Fires</em>. It&rsquo;s an amazing, brutal, epic horror fantasy story about a knight, priest and little girl on a biblical journey through plague-ridden Europe to eventually try to thwart a primordial chaotic evil in the name of God. It&rsquo;s really quite gross and violent, scary and thrilling. I loved every moment of this book - I feel like Robert Eggers could do a good adaptation of it, if that helps you get the vibe at all.</p>
<p>Also, after reading the book for a bit, I started to recognize the font it was set it and I believe its the font <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/tuna">Tuna</a> which is just funny to me. I know font names don’t really matter and the face actually looks nice for this context. But also it’s called Tuna. Like the fish.</p>

<p>My whole life I&rsquo;d thought that people who drifted off at work were just a bunch of slackers. But now I was that slacker. Only I wasn&rsquo;t slacking. I&rsquo;d gone to sleep early the night before. The thing was, the moment I started feeling even remotely tired, that was the end of it, I was gone, but obviously I didn&rsquo;t notice until I woke up again. When did I fall asleep? How long was I out? I know I&rsquo;d been reading. Then I was half asleep, then asleep. I must have really passed out. And I thought I had it covered. It was the partitions. Hidden from my coworkers, I let my guard down. I was sweating a little, clutching my printout. The red pen in my other hand had run wild while I slept, leaving jagged lines all over the page. &ldquo;Crap,&rdquo; I muttered, then looked around again. It didn&rsquo;t seem like Kasumi had heard. The room was silent as ever. Irinoi and Glasses were working quietly. Or maybe they were sleeping, too. How would I even know? The makeshift walls between us had ensured a new level of privacy. I looked at the printout again and got back to work.</p>

<p>If <em>Wrong Way</em> is a version of the near-future, neo-dystopian reality we&rsquo;re currently living in, then the world of <em>The Factory</em> is what happens when we forget about life <em>before</em> the corporate dystopia. It&rsquo;s like Asimov&rsquo;s <em>Foundation</em> but for bureaucrats.</p>
<p>This book is so odd and intriguing. It&rsquo;s short, but parts of it felt longer than anything else I read this year. It feels so full of meaning, and like every meaning I imagine it&rsquo;s presenting is a trick. It&rsquo;s like a metaphor that is constantly changing what it is a metaphor about. It&rsquo;s as close as I&rsquo;ve come to reading something Lynchian, I think?</p>
<p>I feel like, if it&rsquo;s saying anything, it&rsquo;s something about individualism and the scale of corporations — how you can work for a company and never meet most of the other people working for it — and how that scale robs you of your identity. The idea of being that “cog in a machine” means you’re both a replaceable component, and utterly unimportant. Cogs may be fundamental parts of how the machine works, but they also don’t make the machine what what it is.</p>
<p>Why do we give companies identities while we rob humans of them? There’s something about that here, too. And the way that opportunities lead people into comfortable, meaningless lives. Sometimes you luck into a spot where you’re good. You’re fine. But you don’t matter. What are you supposed to do with that? Work and life are so fundamentally different. But what else are you supposed to do with your life? It’s a paradox we find ourselves in now that commerce and capitalism have taken over the world.</p>
<p>So, to me, The Factory became about capitalist existentialism, I guess? It feels like an important book that our grand children will be forced to read in high school. I really enjoyed it.</p>

<p>In 2023 I listened to Andy Serkis' reading of <em>The Hobbit,</em> and this year I listened to his reading of the first part of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. I&rsquo;ve never read the books completely through, having started <em>Fellowship</em> several times through my teens and eventually losing interest in ever reading them. That is, until I listened to Andy Serkis read <em>The Hobbit.</em></p>
<p>I like audio books. I don&rsquo;t <em>love</em> them. Sometimes, they can really help me get through a book (I listened to <em>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</em>, which I can guarantee I never would have read myself), and at times it can be a great way of really pulling you into a story. But Andy Serkis is doing something else entirely, here. His performance in these audio books is more like that of an audio play. He gives <em>so much</em> to these - he&rsquo;s doing voices, changing his pace and volume dynamically and even inventing melodies to Tolkien&rsquo;s many songs.</p>
<p>I am <em>not</em> recommending you read <em>The Fellowship of the Ring.</em> I&rsquo;m recommending you listen to Andy Serkis reading it. It&rsquo;s really something else.</p>

<p>unlike the Ancient Greeks, who imagined that, someday, machines might replace slave labor so that everyone might enjoy some free time, capital only &ldquo;frees time in order to appropriate it for itself.&rdquo; In other words, the goal of capitalism is not free time but economic growth; any time freed up goes right back into the machine to increase profits. Thus the paradox: The factory is efficient, but it also produces &ldquo;the drive toward the consumption of the person&rsquo;s time up to its outermost, physical limit.&rdquo; Or, as the workplace adage would have it, &ldquo;The only reward for working faster is more work.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have too much to say about <em>Saving Time</em> to put it here. It will be an influence on my thinking and writing for the rest of my life. I strongly believe that <em>everyone</em> should read this book. It&rsquo;s a counterpoint to everything we&rsquo;re told is true about the situation we find ourselves in today. Efficiency, productivity, what &ldquo;value&rdquo; is, what <em>time</em> is. All of what we take for granted as being the structure of the world we&rsquo;re living in is a construct that serves <em>someone.</em> Does it serve you?</p>
<p>Appropriately, I probably spent the most time reading a book this year with <em>Saving Time.</em> I would read a chapter and need to take a break for about a month while the ideas Jenny Odell presented in it swirled around in my head and changed how I thought about <em>everything.</em> It&rsquo;s not a light read. It&rsquo;s not something you should skip, either.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I never read <em>Frankenstein</em> before. I also don&rsquo;t know why I chose the &ldquo;original 1818 text&rdquo; to start with. I don&rsquo;t really know what the difference is between the original 1818 text and the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; text. I&rsquo;ll read both at some point and find out.</p>
<p>All that said, I really enjoyed this 200 year old book. It&rsquo;s both amazing and believable that this book is as old as it is. It feels so deeply archaic in its format and yet so modern in the ideas it presents. Brian Merchant, in <em>The Blood and The Machine</em> specifically calls this novel out as being a Luddite story. Mary Shelley lived during the Luddite uprisings, and was likely sympathetic to their cause. That political spark within <em>Frankenstein</em> feels very relevant to our modern age. Frankenstein is like all of our tech CEOs, dabbling in ideas in the name of &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; and showing little regard, if not outright disgust towards the people his work affects. I read Frankenstein and couldn&rsquo;t help but think of Sam Altman.</p>
<p>But the book is also so tame. I was so surprised how it jumps over the actual creation of the monster - that scene that has become so iconic in the movies we now think of when we hear the name Frankenstein is completely missing from the novel. No &ldquo;it&rsquo;s alive.&rdquo; Not even a description of <em>some</em> of how Frankenstein managed to reanimate the dead. If you aren&rsquo;t paying attention, you might not even realize <em>what</em> he was supposed to have done.</p>
<p>This book used the word &ldquo;wretched&rdquo; more than any book I&rsquo;ve read in my life. It&rsquo;s formatted as frame-within-frame-within-frame narratives, and I didn&rsquo;t know we&rsquo;d get a Frankenstein&rsquo;s Monster that spoke like a well educated 19th century gentleman. The book was so unlike what pop-culture had set me up to expect and I loved it for that. To be surprised by a story penned over two-centuries ago was a really great experience.</p>

<p>This was a really fun book. It&rsquo;s my &ldquo;judge a book by its cover&rdquo; book - and I judged it to look cool. Like with <em>Between Two Fires,</em> this book appeals to a curious part of my interests that I can&rsquo;t explain - I&rsquo;m not a boat person, I haven&rsquo;t spent time at sea, I don&rsquo;t even really <em>want</em> to be on or around boats, but I <em>love</em> a sea-faring adventure. It&rsquo;s likely some combination of growing up watching Sinbad and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, but I&rsquo;m just drawn to stories about big ships and sea monsters or disasters at sea.</p>
<p>And this one <em>delivers.</em> If I can critique the book at all, it&rsquo;s maybe that it&rsquo;s a bit long. It could definitely have used some trimming, but when its going, it&rsquo;s a real romp. The characters are super fun, the stakes are high, the setting and the plot are novel and unique. I&rsquo;ll definitely be reading more of these if there do end up being more in the series.</p>
<hr>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I read this year. I&rsquo;m really happy to have passed my goal of one book per month - even if I did sometimes pass months reading very little. I didn&rsquo;t realize the themes of work, labour, Luddism and technology running through these books until I sat down to write this, but I guess it isn&rsquo;t surprising that these were the ideas I was drawn to, considering what&rsquo;s going on in the world and what I&rsquo;ve been thinking about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aiming for <em>more of the same</em> with my reading goals for next year. I&rsquo;m not upping the ante, instead hoping to again read at least one book a month and to maybe expand my horizons more on the perspectives and genres of what I read. I don&rsquo;t</p>

<p>About a year ago I started to notice some fatigue and pain in my hands from working at a desk all day. Eventually, I decided to splurge on a fancy split keyboard - the <a href="https://www.zsa.io/voyager">ZSA Voyager.</a></p>
<p>I’ve been using that in addition to switching to the <a href="https://colemak.com">Colemak keyboard layout</a>, which have both really improved my comfort while typing. Maybe the biggest change is just engaging my <em>awareness</em> around how my hands and body feel when I’m working at a desk. The biggest help hasn’t been one single change, but instead forming a habit of <em>variety</em> around my working position. I sit, stand, type wide apart, closer together, and generally try to reposition and move things throughout the day.</p>
<p>One new thing I added recently was some keyboard tenting, using <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/aw/d/B0C22V8WSF?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title">these cheap magnetic phone stands</a> to add a steeper angle to each of the halves of the Voyager. It’s a very different experience and it really only works when I’m standing at my desk — sitting would require a desk so low that my legs wouldn’t fit under it. The result is undeniably <em>different</em> but it wasn’t immediately <em>comfortable</em> because you really do need to float your arms in front of the keyboard to maintain the right angle to type. This is doable for a while, but then fatigue would cause me to rest my arms down which introduced a whole new contortion and discomfort.</p>
<p>I looked at some wrist rests online but was once again confronted by how expensive and ugly things marketed for health, ergonomics, tech  and, worst of all, the intersection of all three are. It’s just not something I was willing to invest in because… well, I want to like the things around me.</p>
<p>So this leads me to a solution: I made some tiny pillows! My partner is super talented and practiced at sewing and I’ve been wanting to learn how to sew. This was actually just a practice project to lead into a bigger sewing project, but why not practice on something useful?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The result is two small, relatively firm pillows that are filled with scrap fabric. They’re dense but not heavy, and they’re a long rectangular shape, meaning you can play around with their orientation and get different kinds of support.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Like everything else in this ergonomic journey, they’re an <em>option.</em> I’ve found them to be super comfortable for some positions and a bit uncomfortable for others. I like to use them while typing, but for general computer use, moving back and forth from keyboard to mouse, it’s a bit cumbersome to add these into the mix.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Overall, my favourite part of these was making them. Learning to sew feels like a long-neglected life skill I’m happy to start demystifying for myself. I’m told my hand-stitching on the one seam we left open for stuffing the pillows is quite neat! I really enjoyed every step of the process.</p>

			 <p>Every time a company like Adobe introduces new “features,” it’s an attempt to make leaving them harder.  
“AI” tools <em>are</em> empowering, just not for you. They empower the companies that offer them by making you rely less on yourself and more on the company.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A few weeks ago I published a piece about how <a href="https://www.everyonescreative.net/p/ai-companies-think-youre-stupid">AI is showing up in everything, even Adobe Acrobat.</a> It’s now well beyond ridiculous, and the one thing I didn’t articulate with words but explored a bit with visuals is the absolutely hilarious way that AI is elevated to this omnipotent, god-like status &ndash; it’s something so powerful and dangerous that we don’t understand how incredible it is &ndash; but then we use it to do some of the most mundane, trivial shit. It’s like asking Jesus to put together your IKEA for you.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/153694/2024/image.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://emilygorcenski.com/post/making-god/">People much smarter than me</a> have pointed out how AI evangelists speak about “AGI” (Artificial <em>General</em> Intelligence) and technology in general with a fully religious fervour. It’s part of what is so off-putting about AI tools to me. Like Web3, crypto, NFTs and basically any other cyber-cult there’s this uncritical dogma circling AI that forces you to accept certain things as fact before you can even join the conversation. And I just don’t. It doesn’t follow, to me, that a sufficiently complex auto-complete text generator will somehow ascend toward full god-level intelligence. I don’t believe it. And because I don’t believe <em>that</em> everything that follows is just impossible to believe.</p>
<p>Conversely, the people that <em>do</em> accept the dogma now have a solid logical framework for everything else to build off of. It makes perfect sense that every business will want to integrate AI into their products and their workflows &ndash; who wouldn’t want a GOD on their side?</p>
<p>This is where the absurdity of the comparison slots into place for me. I just don’t get how we can ask god to do our homework for us. I don’t understand how it seems like a good use of a cyber-deity to summarize an email for you. It reminds me of when I watch Survivor and people are <em>praying to god</em> to save them from being voted out. Is that a good use of your god’s infinite, transcendent power and influence? To keep you on a game show?</p>
<p>Anyways, this whole rant was just meant to set up the rationale behind the images I made to go with that recent post. I discovered <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/passio-verbigenae/">these amazing prints on The Public Domain Review</a> and when I thought of contrasting them with the meaningless word trash Adobe created to promote Acrobat AI, it felt too funny not to try it out.</p>

<p>I really love how lame the marketing language looks when you pair it with literal biblical imagery.</p>
<p>Working on <em>Everyone’s Creative</em> has been interesting in how it’s helped me widen what I let myself create for the newsletter. Before, when it was still <em>Robot Fan Club</em> it felt very closely tied to my identity as an illustrator. I felt a real pressure (from myself) to draw a lot of the imagery I used to support the writing. Sometimes it worked really well! Sometimes I was clearly less into it. With this new name and framing, though, I feel way more free to play with design, collage, typography and visual metaphor in a way that has been a lot of fun. The visual identity that is growing around <em>Everyone’s Creative</em> is really energizing me.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to experimenting more with the art I make for EC. It feels like a new “era” for my work and I feel so much more excited about making things recently than I have in a long time. Turns out I like novelty!</p>

<p>I already wrote about why I left the company, but to sum up: the business changed and I didn’t like/support these changes, I wanted to reconnect with my community of art and illustration friends/colleagues, and I wanted to work on things that mattered to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://accidental-expert.com/p/hello-procreate">Kyle Webster, <em>Hello, Procreate.</em></a></p>
<p>The discourse around Adobe recently has highlighted what I have been saying about artists being at odds with corporations. While Adobe’s recent PR messes are worth being upset about, I think it’s important we realize how small of a change it was — they were already so misaligned from the values and needs of most of the artists forced to use their tools.</p>
<p>It’s illuminating to hear that the company has shifted so much that it’s driving such important artists away. A boon for Procreate, but a real black mark on Adobe. What does it say about your culture and priorities when this is the reason people cite for leaving?</p>
<p>Adobe is such a perfect case study in how to squander a reputation and burn bridges. But more than that, they represent a lesson we should all take away as artists: don’t let yourself become dependant on tools or companies. Your power is in your ability to create — not to create with something.</p>
<p>Lastly, I just feel like we need to say this all the time: don’t take anything companies or CEOs say at face value. Adobe will always say they value artists because we are the only reason they exist — but what do their actions say?</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m really enjoying playing around with Micro.blog to set up a new simple site for myself. It&rsquo;s definitely for tinkerers and, like Mastodon, probably too fiddly to become a global phenomenon, but it&rsquo;s also way more inspiring and interesting than other &ldquo;social media&rdquo; has ever been to me.</p>
