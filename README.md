# Custom Theme for [simonpeng.net](https://simonpeng.net)

Trying out making a custom theme for my micro.blog site. This is also my first experiment with using Github and Git in general since... a very long time. It's also my first time doing all of this on my own without more experienced people dragging me along. All this is to say that it should be a fun experience but is likely not very useful for anyone else.

I think I'm starting to wrap my head around this. But it's staggeringly unintuative.
