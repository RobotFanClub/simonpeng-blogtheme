About a year ago I started to notice some fatigue and pain in my hands from working at a desk all day. Eventually, I decided to splurge on a fancy split keyboard - the ZSA Voyager.
I‚Äôve been using that in addition to switching to the Colemak keyboard layout, which have both really improved my comfort while typing. Maybe the biggest change is just engaging my awareness around how my hands and body feel when I‚Äôm working at a desk. The biggest help hasn‚Äôt been one single change, but instead forming a habit of variety around my working position. I sit, stand, type wide apart, closer together, and generally try to reposition and move things throughout the day.">

<p>About a year ago I started to notice some fatigue and pain in my hands from working at a desk all day. Eventually, I decided to splurge on a fancy split keyboard - the <a href="https://www.zsa.io/voyager">ZSA Voyager.</a></p>
<p>I‚Äôve been using that in addition to switching to the <a href="https://colemak.com">Colemak keyboard layout</a>, which have both really improved my comfort while typing. Maybe the biggest change is just engaging my <em>awareness</em> around how my hands and body feel when I‚Äôm working at a desk. The biggest help hasn‚Äôt been one single change, but instead forming a habit of <em>variety</em> around my working position. I sit, stand, type wide apart, closer together, and generally try to reposition and move things throughout the day.</p>
<p>One new thing I added recently was some keyboard tenting, using <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/aw/d/B0C22V8WSF?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title">these cheap magnetic phone stands</a> to add a steeper angle to each of the halves of the Voyager. It‚Äôs a very different experience and it really only works when I‚Äôm standing at my desk ‚Äî sitting would require a desk so low that my legs wouldn‚Äôt fit under it. The result is undeniably <em>different</em> but it wasn‚Äôt immediately <em>comfortable</em> because you really do need to float your arms in front of the keyboard to maintain the right angle to type. This is doable for a while, but then fatigue would cause me to rest my arms down which introduced a whole new contortion and discomfort.</p>
<p>I looked at some wrist rests online but was once again confronted by how expensive and ugly things marketed for health, ergonomics, tech  and, worst of all, the intersection of all three are. It‚Äôs just not something I was willing to invest in because‚Ä¶ well, I want to like the things around me.</p>
<p>So this leads me to a solution: I made some tiny pillows! My partner is super talented and practiced at sewing and I‚Äôve been wanting to learn how to sew. This was actually just a practice project to lead into a bigger sewing project, but why not practice on something useful?</p>
<img src="uploads/2024/666140a641.jpg" alt="The two pillows I sewed." width="500" height="auto">
<p>The result is two small, relatively firm pillows that are filled with scrap fabric. They‚Äôre dense but not heavy, and they‚Äôre a long rectangular shape, meaning you can play around with their orientation and get different kinds of support.</p>

<img src="uploads/2024/0f921f6f7c.jpg" alt="Left hand resting on pillow and using keyboard." width="500" height="auto">
<p>Like everything else in this ergonomic journey, they‚Äôre an <em>option.</em> I‚Äôve found them to be super comfortable for some positions and a bit uncomfortable for others. I like to use them while typing, but for general computer use, moving back and forth from keyboard to mouse, it‚Äôs a bit cumbersome to add these into the mix.</p>

<img src="uploads/2024/d1008c0c91.jpg" alt="Shallower tented keyboard with pillow supporting forearm instead of wrist." width="500" height="auto">
<p>Overall, my favourite part of these was making them. Learning to sew feels like a long-neglected life skill I‚Äôm happy to start demystifying for myself. I‚Äôm told my hand-stitching on the one seam we left open for stuffing the pillows is quite neat! I really enjoyed every step of the process.</p>
