  <article class="post-content e-content">
    <p>A few weeks ago I published a piece about how <a href="https://www.everyonescreative.net/p/ai-companies-think-youre-stupid">AI is showing up in everything, even Adobe Acrobat.</a> It‚Äôs now well beyond ridiculous, and the one thing I didn‚Äôt articulate with words but explored a bit with visuals is the absolutely hilarious way that AI is elevated to this omnipotent, god-like status &ndash; it‚Äôs something so powerful and dangerous that we don‚Äôt understand how incredible it is &ndash; but then we use it to do some of the most mundane, trivial shit. It‚Äôs like asking Jesus to put together your IKEA for you.</p>
<p><img src="https://simonpeng.net/uploads/2024/image.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://emilygorcenski.com/post/making-god/">People much smarter than me</a> have pointed out how AI evangelists speak about ‚ÄúAGI‚Äù (Artificial <em>General</em> Intelligence) and technology in general with a fully religious fervour. It‚Äôs part of what is so off-putting about AI tools to me. Like Web3, crypto, NFTs and basically any other cyber-cult there‚Äôs this uncritical dogma circling AI that forces you to accept certain things as fact before you can even join the conversation. And I just don‚Äôt. It doesn‚Äôt follow, to me, that a sufficiently complex auto-complete text generator will somehow ascend toward full god-level intelligence. I don‚Äôt believe it. And because I don‚Äôt believe <em>that</em> everything that follows is just impossible to believe.</p>
<p>Conversely, the people that <em>do</em> accept the dogma now have a solid logical framework for everything else to build off of. It makes perfect sense that every business will want to integrate AI into their products and their workflows &ndash; who wouldn‚Äôt want a GOD on their side?</p>
<p>This is where the absurdity of the comparison slots into place for me. I just don‚Äôt get how we can ask god to do our homework for us. I don‚Äôt understand how it seems like a good use of a cyber-deity to summarize an email for you. It reminds me of when I watch Survivor and people are <em>praying to god</em> to save them from being voted out. Is that a good use of your god‚Äôs infinite, transcendent power and influence? To keep you on a game show?</p>
<p>Anyways, this whole rant was just meant to set up the rationale behind the images I made to go with that recent post. I discovered <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/passio-verbigenae/">these amazing prints on The Public Domain Review</a> and when I thought of contrasting them with the meaningless word trash Adobe created to promote Acrobat AI, it felt too funny not to try it out.</p>

<p>I really love how lame the marketing language looks when you pair it with literal biblical imagery.</p>
<p>Working on <em>Everyone‚Äôs Creative</em> has been interesting in how it‚Äôs helped me widen what I let myself create for the newsletter. Before, when it was still <em>Robot Fan Club</em> it felt very closely tied to my identity as an illustrator. I felt a real pressure (from myself) to draw a lot of the imagery I used to support the writing. Sometimes it worked really well! Sometimes I was clearly less into it. With this new name and framing, though, I feel way more free to play with design, collage, typography and visual metaphor in a way that has been a lot of fun. The visual identity that is growing around <em>Everyone‚Äôs Creative</em> is really energizing me.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm looking forward to experimenting more with the art I make for EC. It feels like a new ‚Äúera‚Äù for my work and I feel so much more excited about making things recently than I have in a long time. Turns out I like novelty!</p>
