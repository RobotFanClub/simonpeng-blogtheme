 Kyle Webster, Hello, Procreate.
The discourse around Adobe recently has highlighted what I have been saying about artists being at odds with corporations. While Adobe‚Äôs recent PR messes are worth being upset about, I think it‚Äôs important we realize how small of a change it was ‚Äî they were already so misaligned from the values and needs of most of the artists forced to use their tools.">

<p>The discourse around Adobe recently has highlighted what I have been saying about artists being at odds with corporations. While Adobe‚Äôs recent PR messes are worth being upset about, I think it‚Äôs important we realize how small of a change it was ‚Äî they were already so misaligned from the values and needs of most of the artists forced to use their tools.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs illuminating to hear that the company has shifted so much that it‚Äôs driving such important artists away. A boon for Procreate, but a real black mark on Adobe. What does it say about your culture and priorities when this is the reason people cite for leaving?</p>
<p>Adobe is such a perfect case study in how to squander a reputation and burn bridges. But more than that, they represent a lesson we should all take away as artists: don‚Äôt let yourself become dependant on tools or companies. Your power is in your ability to create ‚Äî not to create with something.</p>
<p>Lastly, I just feel like we need to say this all the time: don‚Äôt take anything companies or CEOs say at face value. Adobe will always say they value artists because we are the only reason they exist ‚Äî but what do their actions say?</p>
