Does good design tend to lean centre-left? Some of the most iconic poster design I can think of is explicitly communist.</p>\n<p>Does bad design make people feel less united? I personally know I don‚Äôt want to be identified with things that are just objectively ugly or incompetent.</p>\n<p>Can design help heal the divide we‚Äôre seeing politically around the world? I feel like that‚Äôs a big ask.</p>",
