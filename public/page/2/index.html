                            <p>I&rsquo;m a slow reader and I often lose interest in reading <em>in general</em> for months at a time. I also really <em>value</em> reading and I feel better when I do it than when I don&rsquo;t for months at a time.</p>
<p>At the start of 2024 I set a modest goal for myself to, by the end of the year, have read a book a month (on average). So, twelve books in twelve months. I know that&rsquo;s not very much for some, including past versions of myself, but it felt like something I could manage or even exceed.</p>
<p>And I <em>did</em> manage <em>and</em> exceed it. Wrapping up the year, I&rsquo;ve read (or listened to) 13 books. I also started taking more deliberate notes while reading, and so I thought it would be fun to review to books I read and give some thoughts on them.</p>

<p>nothing is impossible to try. Some systemic order telling you something isn&rsquo;t allowed or is impossible is fundamentally wrong. You can try to fly, draw, set fires with your mind, tell stories, make things better for others, invent something you&rsquo;ve always dreamed of‚Äîyou might not succeed, but you can always try.</p>

<p>This is relevant to everyone, but <em>especially</em> artists working online and with digital tools.</p>
<p>Every part of making things ‚Äî from brainstorming to creating to sharing your work ‚Äî is being commodified and offered for a monthly fee. And the more we depend on these systems and tools, the more things shift further into the domain of the capitalists and the tech evangelists.</p>
<p>This is why I‚Äôm becoming so much more sceptical of the idea that every new emerging technology is inevitable and needs to be embraced or you‚Äôll fall behind. That idea so obviously benefits the people marketing tech and not the people using it or creating culture. We do have a say in it, too, you know?</p>

<p>About a year ago I started to notice some fatigue and pain in my hands from working at a desk all day. Eventually, I decided to splurge on a fancy split keyboard - the <a href="https://www.zsa.io/voyager">ZSA Voyager.</a></p>
<p>I‚Äôve been using that in addition to switching to the <a href="https://colemak.com">Colemak keyboard layout</a>, which have both really improved my comfort while typing. Maybe the biggest change is just engaging my <em>awareness</em> around how my hands and body feel when I‚Äôm working at a desk. The biggest help hasn‚Äôt been one single change, but instead forming a habit of <em>variety</em> around my working position. I sit, stand, type wide apart, closer together, and generally try to reposition and move things throughout the day.</p>

                    <p>Every time a company like Adobe introduces new ‚Äúfeatures,‚Äù it‚Äôs an attempt to make leaving them harder. ‚Ä©
‚ÄúAI‚Äù tools <em>are</em> empowering, just not for you. They empower the companies that offer them by making you rely less on yourself and more on the company.</p>

<p>When Adobe push AI, they‚Äôre pushing deeper commitment to their platform. They want you to depend on them, because that gives them power over you.</p>

                    <p>When I work with clients, I push them to stop looking for an objective reason to do something creative and instead lean into what they believe. The biggest surprise about this process, to me, is how almost <em>everyone</em> can step up and do that. <a href="https://www.everyonescreative.net/p/lets-normalize-creativity">So I&rsquo;m trying to do that for myself, too.</a></p>

                            <p>A few weeks ago I published a piece about how <a href="https://www.everyonescreative.net/p/ai-companies-think-youre-stupid">AI is showing up in everything, even Adobe Acrobat.</a> It‚Äôs now well beyond ridiculous, and the one thing I didn‚Äôt articulate with words but explored a bit with visuals is the absolutely hilarious way that AI is elevated to this omnipotent, god-like status &ndash; it‚Äôs something so powerful and dangerous that we don‚Äôt understand how incredible it is &ndash; but then we use it to do some of the most mundane, trivial shit. It‚Äôs like asking Jesus to put together your IKEA for you.</p>

                            <blockquote>
<p>I already wrote about why I left the company, but to sum up: the business changed and I didn‚Äôt like/support these changes, I wanted to reconnect with my community of art and illustration friends/colleagues, and I wanted to work on things that mattered to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://accidental-expert.com/p/hello-procreate">Kyle Webster, <em>Hello, Procreate.</em></a></p>
<p>The discourse around Adobe recently has highlighted what I have been saying about artists being at odds with corporations. While Adobe‚Äôs recent PR messes are worth being upset about, I think it‚Äôs important we realize how small of a change it was ‚Äî they were already so misaligned from the values and needs of most of the artists forced to use their tools.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs illuminating to hear that the company has shifted so much that it‚Äôs driving such important artists away. A boon for Procreate, but a real black mark on Adobe. What does it say about your culture and priorities when this is the reason people cite for leaving?</p>
<p>Adobe is such a perfect case study in how to squander a reputation and burn bridges. But more than that, they represent a lesson we should all take away as artists: don‚Äôt let yourself become dependant on tools or companies. Your power is in your ability to create ‚Äî not to create with something.</p>
<p>Lastly, I just feel like we need to say this all the time: don‚Äôt take anything companies or CEOs say at face value. Adobe will always say they value artists because we are the only reason they exist ‚Äî but what do their actions say?</p>
