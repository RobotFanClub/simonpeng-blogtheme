              <p>The CBC logo is so crazy iconic. It’s odd to feel patriotic about branding but Canadians have it pretty good in this regard. CBC, the (formerly public) CN Rail brand, the Canadian flag 🇨🇦 There’s a lot of great design baked into our nation and there’s probably something to be said about how that used to bring us together.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.logohistories.com/p/cbc-logo-1974">www.logohistories.com/p/cbc-log&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Interesting that the worst design I saw from the big parties during the election was pretty clearly all from the conservatives, who are also the most polarizing and populist voice in our politics right now. Does good design tend to lean centre-left? Some of the most iconic poster design I can think of is explicitly communist.</p>
<p>Does bad design make people feel less united? I personally know I don’t want to be identified with things that are just objectively ugly or incompetent.</p>
<p>Can design help heal the divide we’re seeing politically around the world? I feel like that’s a big ask.</p>

              <p>As more and more people seem to be blindly accepting that AI belongs everywhere, whether it makes any sense or not, I think it’s important to demystify AI more and talk about the people trying to push for this future. Who does it actually benefit? What do they value? Why are we just going along with it?</p>
<p>This is a great interview and a very revealing conversation about the company behind some of the most popular AI products today. If you use AI tools, you should understand where (and who) they come from before you make them an indispensable part of how you work and think.</p>

<p>Imagine if we eliminated the middle-man and artists didn’t need to beg for money on Patreon and justify the (commercial) value of their work.</p>
<p>We should all want to cultivate a rich culture. Arts funding should go hand-in-hand with science funding. We can’t say what the tangible benefits of space exploration or creative exploration will be but they both can yield results nobody could plan for.</p>

</ul>
<p>I don’t disagree with this take, but I do wonder if anyone willingly finds themself in the “repeatable deliverables” situation of their own volition.</p>
<p>I do a lot of the same things in my work, but over-optimizing a system and doing things exactly the same way every day becomes so boring and soulless. I’m constantly re-working how I arrive at a finished product and that in turn refines what I make (the quality and the process and experience of the making).</p>
<p>Before factories and mass-production and Taylorism, things were much more freeform. Craftspeople built their own tools and constantly reimagined what they did. Art and “production” are only different when someone else is forcing you to produce repetitively and in a standardized way. That’s where you become replaceable: when you’re just a stand-in for a machine.</p>
<p>As with so many other issues, is AI showing us where we need to pivot in order to stay relevant or is it revealing to us where the exploitation and power structures already are in our society?</p>

              <p>The one nice thing about having to completely disassemble your printer to try to unclog it is that you can remove the horrible little speaker that chimes every time you press any button on it and that has no mute function in the settings. 😇</p>

              <p>So far this printer repair has slightly increased the amount of black coming through and now completely ruined the colour 😂</p>
<p>Side note… did you know the “cleaning” mode of your printer is just it blasting a bunch of ink into sponges inside the printer? I didn’t but it seems funny for some reason.</p>

              <p>Spending a not insignificant amount of time trying to repair a long-neglected printer and thinking about how much work this is, how nobody who is sane would do this, and how many fucking printers must be in the landfills so we can all print… what? Movie tickets? Bills?</p>
