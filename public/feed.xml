      <description>&lt;p&gt;The CBC logo is so crazy iconic. It‚Äôs odd to feel patriotic about branding but Canadians have it pretty good in this regard. CBC, the (formerly public) CN Rail brand, the Canadian flag üá®üá¶ There‚Äôs a lot of great design baked into our nation and there‚Äôs probably something to be said about how that used to bring us together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.logohistories.com/p/cbc-logo-1974&#34;&gt;www.logohistories.com/p/cbc-log&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting that the worst design I saw from the big parties during the election was pretty clearly all from the conservatives, who are also the most polarizing and populist voice in our politics right now. Does good design tend to lean centre-left? Some of the most iconic poster design I can think of is explicitly communist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does bad design make people feel less united? I personally know I don‚Äôt want to be identified with things that are just objectively ugly or incompetent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can design help heal the divide we‚Äôre seeing politically around the world? I feel like that‚Äôs a big ask.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have had to dip back into working with Adobe applications a bit, and am having the &amp;ldquo;pleasure&amp;rdquo; of using Microsoft Office programs to set up templates for clients. Both are amazing me with these little features I look for only to find out they&amp;rsquo;re known issues with many years of people requesting them and the general response to the request is just &amp;ldquo;Unfortunately, that just doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist :( Sorry!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aren&amp;rsquo;t these two of the biggest software companies on earth? It&amp;rsquo;s almost like their primary interest &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; in making their tools better for the people that use them&amp;hellip; ü§î&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With so many big, existential issues going on all the time it feels like there‚Äôs no space to enjoy the things that we do. But if you never have any fun, you aren‚Äôt going to want to do anything, and nothing is going to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, whatever you‚Äôre doing, remember to try to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.everyonescreative.net/p/this-is-the-secret-to-actually-making&#34;&gt;have fun!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today in being an over-enthusiastic Linux beginner: made a typo in the terminal and accidentally rewrote the permissions of every file in my system and destroyed the operating system. Fun! This is why you make backups, I guess!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As more and more people seem to be blindly accepting that AI belongs everywhere, whether it makes any sense or not, I think it‚Äôs important to demystify AI more and talk about the people trying to push for this future. Who does it actually benefit? What do they value? Why are we just going along with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great interview and a very revealing conversation about the company behind some of the most popular AI products today. If you use AI tools, you should understand where (and who) they come from before you make them an indispensable part of how you work and think.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know Ireland launched a basic income pilot just for artists? ‚Ç¨325/week for 3 years. Not charity‚Äîit&amp;rsquo;s recognition that art is essential work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://substack.com/@shagunsingh/note/c-111837880?&#34;&gt;via Shagun Singh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if we eliminated the middle-man and artists didn‚Äôt need to beg for money on Patreon and justify the (commercial) value of their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should all want to cultivate a rich culture. Arts funding should go hand-in-hand with science funding. We can‚Äôt say what the tangible benefits of space exploration or creative exploration will be but they both can yield results nobody could plan for.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn‚Äôt feel much when I deleted my Facebook account. I mostly felt fatigue when I deleted my Twitter. But deleting my Reddit account feels so freeing. I don‚Äôt know why I felt like there was any value in reading the thoughts of anonymous idiots on every little topic. It‚Äôs madness. Get out of there!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been pushing myself to use more open source software, but for graphic design work I still feel very trapped with either Adobe or Affinity. That said, I&amp;rsquo;m working with Inkscape and I&amp;rsquo;m not having a &lt;em&gt;horrible&lt;/em&gt; time. It&amp;rsquo;s clunky, but also capable (once you figure out where things are buried).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is a nice day to learn that old workplace safety manuals have some pretty hilarious images when you take them out of context!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is AI a threat? Or does it just expose the existing threats?</title>
      <link>https://simonpeng.net/2025/04/30/is-ai-a-threat-or.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 14:04:49 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://simonpeng.micro.blog/2025/04/30/is-ai-a-threat-or.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI will outpace humans in all structured tasks. If you‚Äôre producing repeatable deliverables, you will be automated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://open.substack.com/pub/beinginspace/p/ai-and-money&#34;&gt;Being in Space&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt disagree with this take, but I do wonder if anyone willingly finds themself in the ‚Äúrepeatable deliverables‚Äù situation of their own volition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do a lot of the same things in my work, but over-optimizing a system and doing things exactly the same way every day becomes so boring and soulless. I‚Äôm constantly re-working how I arrive at a finished product and that in turn refines what I make (the quality and the process and experience of the making).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before factories and mass-production and Taylorism, things were much more freeform. Craftspeople built their own tools and constantly reimagined what they did. Art and ‚Äúproduction‚Äù are only different when someone else is forcing you to produce repetitively and in a standardized way. That‚Äôs where you become replaceable: when you‚Äôre just a stand-in for a machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with so many other issues, is AI showing us where we need to pivot in order to stay relevant or is it revealing to us where the exploitation and power structures already are in our society?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking at the results of our Canadian election is such a mixed bag of emotions. I‚Äôm glad to see we haven‚Äôt completely fallen into the conservative hell of the US, but the collapse of the NDP feels like we‚Äôre on our way into cementing the same two-party system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn‚Äôt like any of the off-the-shelf cable management boxes for standing desks because they usually are for when your desk is against a wall. So I made this box that presses into the desk with tension and hides the nasty cables! Fun hand tool project! Still needs finishing, but I like it so far!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The one nice thing about having to completely disassemble your printer to try to unclog it is that you can remove the horrible little speaker that chimes every time you press any button on it and that has no mute function in the settings. üòá&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So far this printer repair has slightly increased the amount of black coming through and now completely ruined the colour üòÇ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note‚Ä¶ did you know the ‚Äúcleaning‚Äù mode of your printer is just it blasting a bunch of ink into sponges inside the printer? I didn‚Äôt but it seems funny for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spending a not insignificant amount of time trying to repair a long-neglected printer and thinking about how much work this is, how nobody who is sane would do this, and how many fucking printers must be in the landfills so we can all print‚Ä¶ what? Movie tickets? Bills?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.everyonescreative.net/p/we-have-to-stop-pretending-creativity&#34;&gt;We have to stop pretending creativity is &amp;ldquo;magic.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;
I feel like the only way to build solidarity for creative labour is by sharing your process and making it clear that you &lt;strong&gt;aren‚Äôt&lt;/strong&gt; magically talented.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about the fear people have of AI and the threats it poses to artists. But I feel like there‚Äôs one big threat most people are missing: how it will affect the way we work with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
