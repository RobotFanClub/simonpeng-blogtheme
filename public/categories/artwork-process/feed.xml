      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.everyonescreative.net/p/we-have-to-stop-pretending-creativity&#34;&gt;We have to stop pretending creativity is &amp;ldquo;magic.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;
I feel like the only way to build solidarity for creative labour is by sharing your process and making it clear that you &lt;strong&gt;aren‚Äôt&lt;/strong&gt; magically talented.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AI isn‚Äôt God - A bit about absurdity and highlighting contrasts.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I published a piece about how &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.everyonescreative.net/p/ai-companies-think-youre-stupid&#34;&gt;AI is showing up in everything, even Adobe Acrobat.&lt;/a&gt; It‚Äôs now well beyond ridiculous, and the one thing I didn‚Äôt articulate with words but explored a bit with visuals is the absolutely hilarious way that AI is elevated to this omnipotent, god-like status &amp;ndash; it‚Äôs something so powerful and dangerous that we don‚Äôt understand how incredible it is &amp;ndash; but then we use it to do some of the most mundane, trivial shit. It‚Äôs like asking Jesus to put together your IKEA for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://simonpeng.net/uploads/2024/image.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://emilygorcenski.com/post/making-god/&#34;&gt;People much smarter than me&lt;/a&gt; have pointed out how AI evangelists speak about ‚ÄúAGI‚Äù (Artificial &lt;em&gt;General&lt;/em&gt; Intelligence) and technology in general with a fully religious fervour. It‚Äôs part of what is so off-putting about AI tools to me. Like Web3, crypto, NFTs and basically any other cyber-cult there‚Äôs this uncritical dogma circling AI that forces you to accept certain things as fact before you can even join the conversation. And I just don‚Äôt. It doesn‚Äôt follow, to me, that a sufficiently complex auto-complete text generator will somehow ascend toward full god-level intelligence. I don‚Äôt believe it. And because I don‚Äôt believe &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; everything that follows is just impossible to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the people that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; accept the dogma now have a solid logical framework for everything else to build off of. It makes perfect sense that every business will want to integrate AI into their products and their workflows &amp;ndash; who wouldn‚Äôt want a GOD on their side?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the absurdity of the comparison slots into place for me. I just don‚Äôt get how we can ask god to do our homework for us. I don‚Äôt understand how it seems like a good use of a cyber-deity to summarize an email for you. It reminds me of when I watch Survivor and people are &lt;em&gt;praying to god&lt;/em&gt; to save them from being voted out. Is that a good use of your god‚Äôs infinite, transcendent power and influence? To keep you on a game show?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this whole rant was just meant to set up the rationale behind the images I made to go with that recent post. I discovered &lt;a href=&#34;https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/passio-verbigenae/&#34;&gt;these amazing prints on The Public Domain Review&lt;/a&gt; and when I thought of contrasting them with the meaningless word trash Adobe created to promote Acrobat AI, it felt too funny not to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really love how lame the marketing language looks when you pair it with literal biblical imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on &lt;em&gt;Everyone‚Äôs Creative&lt;/em&gt; has been interesting in how it‚Äôs helped me widen what I let myself create for the newsletter. Before, when it was still &lt;em&gt;Robot Fan Club&lt;/em&gt; it felt very closely tied to my identity as an illustrator. I felt a real pressure (from myself) to draw a lot of the imagery I used to support the writing. Sometimes it worked really well! Sometimes I was clearly less into it. With this new name and framing, though, I feel way more free to play with design, collage, typography and visual metaphor in a way that has been a lot of fun. The visual identity that is growing around &lt;em&gt;Everyone‚Äôs Creative&lt;/em&gt; is really energizing me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm looking forward to experimenting more with the art I make for EC. It feels like a new ‚Äúera‚Äù for my work and I feel so much more excited about making things recently than I have in a long time. Turns out I like novelty!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
