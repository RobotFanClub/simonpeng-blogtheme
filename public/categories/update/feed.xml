      <title>AI isn‚Äôt God - A bit about absurdity and highlighting contrasts.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I published a piece about how &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.everyonescreative.net/p/ai-companies-think-youre-stupid&#34;&gt;AI is showing up in everything, even Adobe Acrobat.&lt;/a&gt; It‚Äôs now well beyond ridiculous, and the one thing I didn‚Äôt articulate with words but explored a bit with visuals is the absolutely hilarious way that AI is elevated to this omnipotent, god-like status &amp;ndash; it‚Äôs something so powerful and dangerous that we don‚Äôt understand how incredible it is &amp;ndash; but then we use it to do some of the most mundane, trivial shit. It‚Äôs like asking Jesus to put together your IKEA for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://simonpeng.net/uploads/2024/image.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://emilygorcenski.com/post/making-god/&#34;&gt;People much smarter than me&lt;/a&gt; have pointed out how AI evangelists speak about ‚ÄúAGI‚Äù (Artificial &lt;em&gt;General&lt;/em&gt; Intelligence) and technology in general with a fully religious fervour. It‚Äôs part of what is so off-putting about AI tools to me. Like Web3, crypto, NFTs and basically any other cyber-cult there‚Äôs this uncritical dogma circling AI that forces you to accept certain things as fact before you can even join the conversation. And I just don‚Äôt. It doesn‚Äôt follow, to me, that a sufficiently complex auto-complete text generator will somehow ascend toward full god-level intelligence. I don‚Äôt believe it. And because I don‚Äôt believe &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; everything that follows is just impossible to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the people that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; accept the dogma now have a solid logical framework for everything else to build off of. It makes perfect sense that every business will want to integrate AI into their products and their workflows &amp;ndash; who wouldn‚Äôt want a GOD on their side?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the absurdity of the comparison slots into place for me. I just don‚Äôt get how we can ask god to do our homework for us. I don‚Äôt understand how it seems like a good use of a cyber-deity to summarize an email for you. It reminds me of when I watch Survivor and people are &lt;em&gt;praying to god&lt;/em&gt; to save them from being voted out. Is that a good use of your god‚Äôs infinite, transcendent power and influence? To keep you on a game show?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this whole rant was just meant to set up the rationale behind the images I made to go with that recent post. I discovered &lt;a href=&#34;https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/passio-verbigenae/&#34;&gt;these amazing prints on The Public Domain Review&lt;/a&gt; and when I thought of contrasting them with the meaningless word trash Adobe created to promote Acrobat AI, it felt too funny not to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really love how lame the marketing language looks when you pair it with literal biblical imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on &lt;em&gt;Everyone‚Äôs Creative&lt;/em&gt; has been interesting in how it‚Äôs helped me widen what I let myself create for the newsletter. Before, when it was still &lt;em&gt;Robot Fan Club&lt;/em&gt; it felt very closely tied to my identity as an illustrator. I felt a real pressure (from myself) to draw a lot of the imagery I used to support the writing. Sometimes it worked really well! Sometimes I was clearly less into it. With this new name and framing, though, I feel way more free to play with design, collage, typography and visual metaphor in a way that has been a lot of fun. The visual identity that is growing around &lt;em&gt;Everyone‚Äôs Creative&lt;/em&gt; is really energizing me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm looking forward to experimenting more with the art I make for EC. It feels like a new ‚Äúera‚Äù for my work and I feel so much more excited about making things recently than I have in a long time. Turns out I like novelty!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;New post on Everyone‚Äôs Creative exploring the unnecessary ‚ÄúAI‚Äù features being crammed into everything, how Adobe doesn‚Äôt care about you, and what we give up when we sell off the one thing we don‚Äôt need computers to help with.&lt;/p&gt;
