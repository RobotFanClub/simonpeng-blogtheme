        "content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;m a slow reader and I often lose interest in reading <em>in general</em> for months at a time. I also really <em>value</em> reading and I feel better when I do it than when I don&rsquo;t for months at a time.</p>\n<p>At the start of 2024 I set a modest goal for myself to, by the end of the year, have read a book a month (on average). So, twelve books in twelve months. I know that&rsquo;s not very much for some, including past versions of myself, but it felt like something I could manage or even exceed.</p>\n<p>And I <em>did</em> manage <em>and</em> exceed it. Wrapping up the year, I&rsquo;ve read (or listened to) 13 books. I also started taking more deliberate notes while reading, and so I thought it would be fun to review to books I read and give some thoughts on them.</p>\n<p>I also, part way through the year, set a secondary goal for myself. I started to realize that the books I read are <em>mostly</em> written by men. I also got to enjoy the continued revelation that a <em>lot</em> of men - especially, it seems, famous and/or powerful men - turn out to be pretty awful people. I don&rsquo;t believe in separating the art from the artist - I&rsquo;ll write about that at some point - nor do I believe in throwing out people or art because we disapprove of them. However, I <em>also</em> believe that art and <em>especially</em> writing has the power to shape who you are and how you think, and I don&rsquo;t <em>love</em> the idea that I&rsquo;m - consciously or not - selecting from only half of humans, with higher odds of being <em>bad</em> humans, to read and shape the way I think. So my secondary goal was to have at least <em>half</em> the books I read this year be authored by women (or, not men, more specifically). I&rsquo;m happy to say that I did accomplish that goal, too, and that most of my favourite books I read this year were those women-authored works. Pretty neat!</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m going to go through these in chronological order of when I read them. I&rsquo;ll link where you can find each book, as well, if you&rsquo;d like to read them, too. I recommend everything I read this year, since I usually make sure I&rsquo;ll like books before I commit to them and so rarely read through books I dislike.</p>\n<h1 id=\"blood-in-the-machine\">Blood in The Machine</h1>\n<h2 id=\"by-brian-merchant\">by Brian Merchant</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/blood-in-the-machine-the-origins-of-the-rebellion-against-big-tech-brian-merchant/17824365?ean=9780316487740\">Bookshop.org</a> | <a href=\"https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781549199899-blood-in-the-machine\">Libro.fm</a></p>\n<p><code>Finished January 9, 2024</code></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Incidentally, it is what set later industrial revolutions turning, too. As David Noble, a historian of 20th century automation wrote:\n‚ÄúManagers feel they must automate because ‚Äòeveryone‚Äôs doing it.‚Äô Out of fear that they will be undone by more up-to-date competitors ‚Äî a paranoia encouraged by equipment vendors. There is this vague belief that the drive to automate is inevitable, unavoidable, and this belief becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is my rollover book from 2023. I <em>technically</em> read most of it leading up to the end of the year, but I finished it in January and it had such an impact on my thinking this year that it feels appropriate to kick off this list. I also <em>listened</em> to this book, and I recommend the audio version read by Eric Jason Martin (linked above).</p>\n<p>What can I say about this book? It&rsquo;s one of the most important historical books of our era, I think. We&rsquo;re living in a time when industrialisation and capitalism is running rampant on the globe and <em>technology</em> is being deified and literally evangelized as the upcoming incarnation of god-like power brought to earth. We&rsquo;re facing economic, ethical and environmental crises that are being <em>directly</em> caused by capitalists and their machines and the crazy thing about it is that <em>this has all happened before.</em> <em>Blood in the Machine</em> is the story of the Luddite uprising of the nineteenth century. It&rsquo;s a challenge against our popular understanding of the word &ldquo;Luddite&rdquo; and it is both a warning and a call to action.</p>\n<p>I could probably go on to write many essays (and likely will) about 21st century Luddism and why we need to embrace and uphold the values of the Luddites in our struggles today. I&rsquo;ll leave it here by saying that if you use technology in your work in <em>any way</em> (and you almost certainly do), then you owe it to yourself and your comrades to read this book and to let the voice of Ned Ludd into your heart. I don&rsquo;t imagine we&rsquo;ve seen the end of machine breaking for the working class, and it&rsquo;s important we remember what that represents and understand which side we&rsquo;re on.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-poppy-war\">The Poppy War</h1>\n<h2 id=\"by-rf-kuang\">by R.F.

When man begins to think that he is responsible for writing the script of the world, he forgets the forces that dream up our reality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I like going into books knowing that they&rsquo;re good - that they won&rsquo;t be a waste of my time or that I&rsquo;ll lose interest quickly - but I <em>also</em> like going into books knowing little about their plot. I&rsquo;ll take a recommendation and then dive in without reading the back of the book. That was what I did with <em>The Poppy War.</em> I can&rsquo;t even remember where the recommendation came from, but it had been sitting in my &ldquo;To Read&rdquo; list and came up on my library hold list and I decided to give it a go.</p>\n<p>I <em>really</em> enjoyed aspects of this book, and also found parts of it a bit clumsy or tough to get through. In a funny way, though, I really enjoyed how imperfect it was. It was probably a bit too long, and it had a kind of brutality to it that felt gratuitous at times, but it felt like a very well executed <em>vision.</em> I think what I learned from this book is that, what I enjoy most in a work of art is when I can detect the artists intent and feel like they&rsquo;re mostly <em>nailing</em> what they wanted to do - even if it isn&rsquo;t entirely what I would have done or isn&rsquo;t working for me.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t want to recap the plot or say much more about the book, honestly. If you enjoy fantasy novels or martial arts movies, this is probably something you&rsquo;ll enjoy. Just&hellip; be ready for things to be pretty grim.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-narrow-road-between-desires\">The Narrow Road Between Desires</h1>\n<h2 id=\"by-patrick-rothfuss\">by Patrick Rothfuss</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-narrow-road-between-desires-patrick-rothfuss/20080619?ean=9780756419172\">Bookshop.org</a> | <a href=\"https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9798890594082-the-narrow-road-between-desires\">Libro.fm</a></p>\n<p><code>Finished February 4, 2024</code></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That would be enough for some. But on the rare occasion when he actually cared, Bast found success as dull as ditchwater. Let others settle for mere excellence. Bast was an artist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you haven&rsquo;t read <em>The Name of the Wind</em> or any of Patrick Rothfuss' following work, then this probably isn&rsquo;t a great place to start. But what I love about this book is just how little it matters to the fantasy universe of which it is a part. It makes me appreciate just how much thought and care an author can put into characters and symbols in order to tell simple stories about our lives and our experience. In a world full of spin-offs and reboots, it feels weird to have loved a book that deepens fantasy lore as much as I loved this book, and in a way that&rsquo;s because it <em>actually</em> deepens it, and doesn&rsquo;t just widen it.</p>\n<p>As the years drag on, I find I care less and less if Patrick Rothfuss &ldquo;finishes&rdquo; his trilogy of fantasy novels. While others are loathe to even <em>start</em> reading <em>The Name of the Wind</em> until they know it has a satisfying ending, I get to enjoy the words that have actually been written. I don&rsquo;t know what people hope for when they say they&rsquo;re waiting for a series to be &ldquo;complete&rdquo; before they begin it&hellip; you know you could die any day, right? That likely won&rsquo;t be a satisfying ending either.</p>\n<p><em>The Narrow Road Between Desires</em> is a wonderful little detour in the world of <em>The Kingkiller Chronicles</em> and I hope it was a cathartic process for Patrick Rothfuss, who doesn&rsquo;t owe us anything.</p>\n<h1 id=\"greenwood\">Greenwood</h1>\n<h2 id=\"by-michael-christie\">by Michael Christie</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/greenwood-michael-christie/9574621?ean=9781984822017\">Bookshop.org</a> | <a href=\"https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9780771024474-greenwood\">Libro.fm</a></p>\n<p><code>Finished February 23, 2024</code></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jake has always mistrusted the expression &ldquo;knowing your roots.&rdquo; As though roots by their very definition are knowable. Any dendrologist can tell you that the roots of a mature Douglas fir forest spread for miles. That they&rsquo;re dark and intertwining, tangled and twisted, and impossible to map. That they often fuse together, and even communicate, secretly sharing nutrients and chemical weapons among themselves. So the truth is that there exists no clear distinction between one tree and another. And their roots are anything but knowable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Greenwood</em> is another one of these books that I dove into without really knowing anything about it. It made a bad first impression, honestly, with a near-future dystopian setting and somewhat sarcastic protagonist that felt <em>just</em> a bit too much like I was reading an Andy Weir novel. All of that fell away quickly, though, and this became one of the most engaging books I&rsquo;ve ever read. I can&rsquo;t really overstate it. Reading this felt like I lived a dozen lives and it gave me a sense of connection to my ancestors and to nature that I really cherished.</p>\n<p>There isn&rsquo;t much more I can say. I can&rsquo;t recommend <em>Greenwood</em> enough. It&rsquo;s a really good book.</p>\n<h1 id=\"wrong-way\">Wrong Way</h1>\n<h2 id=\"by-joanne-mcneil\">by Joanne McNeil</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/wrong-way-joanne-mcneil/19559578?ean=9780374610661\">Bookshop.org</a> | <a href=\"https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781666650525-wrong-way\">Libro.fm</a></p>\n<p><code>Finished March 23, 2024</code></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whatever it is, the job is already better than her last five LinkedIn updates. Most of that work happened in mills: old mill yards, old gristmills, old leather mills, old textile mills. Sometimes they were called that. Woollen Mills was one of her old offices but abstracted from its original purpose in time and determination&hellip;\n&hellip;Her temporary coworker at a 3D-printing start-up in Lawrence casually mentioned to her that the Bread and Roses Strike happened at that mill more than a hundred years ago. She never saw him again after that. His contract must have ended.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I read that excerpt of <em>Wrong Way</em> while I ate my lunch at my desk in The Cotton Factory, a converted textile mill in the industrial sector of Hamilton, Ontario. That&rsquo;s when I realized that Joanne McNeil saw the truth about the world in a really honest, clear and oddly objective fashion.</p>\n<p><em>Wrong Way</em> is probably the best &ldquo;dystopian future&rdquo; sci-fi book ever written, and it barely takes place in the future. It&rsquo;s about not-impossible technology, labour, the gig-economy and companies take advantage of how detached we are from one another. Its a book about how we&rsquo;re all being exploited by companies that we support, and how that&rsquo;s kind of okay because we all need to eat, don&rsquo;t we? It&rsquo;s so scathing and simultaneously completely non-judgemental. It&rsquo;s not really like any other book I&rsquo;ve read and I loved every page of it.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a sense of unreality to the book, like we&rsquo;re drifting through a dream, but at the same time the story is incredibly grounded and relatable. It&rsquo;s a funny contrast, and it reminds me of how the days can sort of fall away without much significance when all you&rsquo;re doing is working. <em>Wrong Way</em> asks where your body ends and your work begins, and it often seems to imply that that boundary is mostly imaginary if you let it be - and that&rsquo;s exactly what corporations want from us.</p>\n<p>If <em>Blood in the Machine</em> is a loud, direct Luddite call to action, then <em>Wrong Way</em> is a Luddite nightmare that we&rsquo;re all quietly living and might never realize we can wake up from, if we even can at all.</p>\n<h1 id=\"strong-female-character\">Strong Female Character</h1>\n<h2 id=\"by-fern-brady\">by Fern Brady</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/strong-female-character-fern-brady/19685068?ean=9780593582503\">Bookshop.org</a> | <a href=\"https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9780593793428-strong-female-character\">Libro.fm</a></p>\n<p><code>Finished May 9, 2024</code></p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t read a lot of memoirs, but I read this one because it paralleled the experience my partner had of getting an adult autism diagnosis. Fern Brady is a comedian who we watched on the <em>wonderful</em> British show <em>Taskmaster,</em> and who we&rsquo;d later see live in Toronto. Her memoir takes the approach of sort of retracing her life with the hindsight of her autism diagnosis, and sprinkles a good amount of education on the history of the treatment of and more of the lived experience of autistic people.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a quick read, like many memoirs of relatively young people, but its a lot more informative and engaging. As a late-diagnosed ADHDer, I appreciated the effort that this book represents to turn a memoir into more of a PSA or informative device to help us recognize and support neurodivergent people <em>before</em> their lives become full of avoidable trauma and baggage. Maybe the next generation will have a bit of a better chance, right?</p>\n<h1 id=\"between-two-fires\">Between Two Fires</h1>\n<h2 id=\"by-christopher-buehlman\">by Christopher Buehlman</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/between-two-fires-christopher-buehlman/15286104?ean=9798662731349\">Bookshop.org</a> | <a href=\"https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781483060774-between-two-fires\">Libro.fm</a></p>\n<p><code>Finished June 13, 2024</code></p>\n<p>I think I came across this book in a Reddit thread recommending horror books or something. It sat in my &ldquo;To Read&rdquo; list for some time, until I decided I wanted to read something spooky and ordered a copy. It wasn&rsquo;t until I was about halfway through that I realized it was self-published, which is pretty impressive considering how fucking good this book is (which isn&rsquo;t to say that self-published books are all <em>bad</em>, but more so that I&rsquo;m surprised a publisher hadn&rsquo;t managed to scoop up a book of this quality).</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been primed to like this book after spending a great many hours consumed by the <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> games. I don&rsquo;t really know why, but I&rsquo;m very compelled by medieval horror - especially if it blends cosmic horror with biblical fantasy. I&rsquo;m not religious, and I have yet to have dug much into actual medieval history, but a knight fighting a supernatural horror from some kind of hellish dimension sounds really cool to me.</p>\n<p>So, that&rsquo;s basically why I loved <em>Between Two Fires</em>. It&rsquo;s an amazing, brutal, epic horror fantasy story about a knight, priest and little girl on a biblical journey through plague-ridden Europe to eventually try to thwart a primordial chaotic evil in the name of God. It&rsquo;s really quite gross and violent, scary and thrilling. I loved every moment of this book - I feel like Robert Eggers could do a good adaptation of it, if that helps you get the vibe at all.</p>\n<p>Also, after reading the book for a bit, I started to recognize the font it was set it and I believe its the font <a href=\"https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/tuna\">Tuna</a> which is just funny to me. I know font names don‚Äôt really matter and the face actually looks nice for this context. But also it‚Äôs called Tuna. Like the fish.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-factory\">The Factory</h1>\n<h2 id=\"by-hiroko-oyamada\">by Hiroko Oyamada</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-factory-hiroko-oyamada/12421042?ean=9780811228855\">Bookshop.org</a></p>\n<p><code>Finished August 31, 2024</code></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My whole life I&rsquo;d thought that people who drifted off at work were just a bunch of slackers. But now I was that slacker. Only I wasn&rsquo;t slacking. I&rsquo;d gone to sleep early the night before. The thing was, the moment I started feeling even remotely tired, that was the end of it, I was gone, but obviously I didn&rsquo;t notice until I woke up again. When did I fall asleep? How long was I out? I know I&rsquo;d been reading. Then I was half asleep, then asleep. I must have really passed out. And I thought I had it covered. It was the partitions. Hidden from my coworkers, I let my guard down. I was sweating a little, clutching my printout. The red pen in my other hand had run wild while I slept, leaving jagged lines all over the page. &ldquo;Crap,&rdquo; I muttered, then looked around again. It didn&rsquo;t seem like Kasumi had heard. The room was silent as ever. Irinoi and Glasses were working quietly. Or maybe they were sleeping, too. How would I even know? The makeshift walls between us had ensured a new level of privacy. I looked at the printout again and got back to work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If <em>Wrong Way</em> is a version of the near-future, neo-dystopian reality we&rsquo;re currently living in, then the world of <em>The Factory</em> is what happens when we forget about life <em>before</em> the corporate dystopia. It&rsquo;s like Asimov&rsquo;s <em>Foundation</em> but for bureaucrats.</p>\n<p>This book is so odd and intriguing. It&rsquo;s short, but parts of it felt longer than anything else I read this year. It feels so full of meaning, and like every meaning I imagine it&rsquo;s presenting is a trick. It&rsquo;s like a metaphor that is constantly changing what it is a metaphor about. It&rsquo;s as close as I&rsquo;ve come to reading something Lynchian, I think?</p>\n<p>I feel like, if it&rsquo;s saying anything, it&rsquo;s something about individualism and the scale of corporations ‚Äî how you can work for a company and never meet most of the other people working for it ‚Äî and how that scale robs you of your identity. The idea of being that ‚Äúcog in a machine‚Äù means you‚Äôre both a replaceable component, and utterly unimportant. Cogs may be fundamental parts of how the machine works, but they also don‚Äôt make the machine what what it is.</p>\n<p>Why do we give companies identities while we rob humans of them? There‚Äôs something about that here, too. And the way that opportunities lead people into comfortable, meaningless lives. Sometimes you luck into a spot where you‚Äôre good. You‚Äôre fine. But you don‚Äôt matter. What are you supposed to do with that? Work and life are so fundamentally different. But what else are you supposed to do with your life? It‚Äôs a paradox we find ourselves in now that commerce and capitalism have taken over the world.</p>\n<p>So, to me, The Factory became about capitalist existentialism, I guess? It feels like an important book that our grand children will be forced to read in high school. I really enjoyed it.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-hike\">The Hike</h1>\n<h2 id=\"by-drew-magary\">by Drew Magary</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-hike-drew-magary/7380362?ean=9780399563874\">Bookshop.org </a>| <a href=\"https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781511391962-the-hike\">Libro.fm</a></p>\n<p><code>Finished September 4, 2024</code></p>\n<p>Another book I knew very little about going into and that I was really taken away by.

That is, until I listened to Andy Serkis read <em>The Hobbit.</em></p>\n<p>I like audio books. I don&rsquo;t <em>love</em> them. Sometimes, they can really help me get through a book (I listened to <em>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</em>, which I can guarantee I never would have read myself), and at times it can be a great way of really pulling you into a story. But Andy Serkis is doing something else entirely, here. His performance in these audio books is more like that of an audio play. He gives <em>so much</em> to these - he&rsquo;s doing voices, changing his pace and volume dynamically and even inventing melodies to Tolkien&rsquo;s many songs.</p>\n<p>I am <em>not</em> recommending you read <em>The Fellowship of the Ring.</em> I&rsquo;m recommending you listen to Andy Serkis reading it.

Thus the paradox: The factory is efficient, but it also produces &ldquo;the drive toward the consumption of the person&rsquo;s time up to its outermost, physical limit.&rdquo; Or, as the workplace adage would have it, &ldquo;The only reward for working faster is more work.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have too much to say about <em>Saving Time</em> to put it here.

It&rsquo;s a counterpoint to everything we&rsquo;re told is true about the situation we find ourselves in today. Efficiency, productivity, what &ldquo;value&rdquo; is, what <em>time</em> is. All of what we take for granted as being the structure of the world we&rsquo;re living in is a construct that serves <em>someone.</em> Does it serve you?</p>\n<p>Appropriately, I probably spent the most time reading a book this year with <em>Saving Time.</em> I would read a chapter and need to take a break for about a month while the ideas Jenny Odell presented in it swirled around in my head and changed how I thought about <em>everything.</em> It&rsquo;s not a light read.

I don&rsquo;t really know what the difference is between the original 1818 text and the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; text. I&rsquo;ll read both at some point and find out.</p>\n<p>All that said, I really enjoyed this 200 year old book. It&rsquo;s both amazing and believable that this book is as old as it is. It feels so deeply archaic in its format and yet so modern in the ideas it presents. Brian Merchant, in <em>The Blood and The Machine</em> specifically calls this novel out as being a Luddite story. Mary Shelley lived during the Luddite uprisings, and was likely sympathetic to their cause. That political spark within <em>Frankenstein</em> feels very relevant to our modern age. Frankenstein is like all of our tech CEOs, dabbling in ideas in the name of &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; and showing little regard, if not outright disgust towards the people his work affects. I read Frankenstein and couldn&rsquo;t help but think of Sam Altman.</p>\n<p>But the book is also so tame. I was so surprised how it jumps over the actual creation of the monster - that scene that has become so iconic in the movies we now think of when we hear the name Frankenstein is completely missing from the novel. No &ldquo;it&rsquo;s alive.&rdquo; Not even a description of <em>some</em> of how Frankenstein managed to reanimate the dead. If you aren&rsquo;t paying attention, you might not even realize <em>what</em> he was supposed to have done.</p>\n<p>This book used the word &ldquo;wretched&rdquo; more than any book I&rsquo;ve read in my life. It&rsquo;s formatted as frame-within-frame-within-frame narratives, and I didn&rsquo;t know we&rsquo;d get a Frankenstein&rsquo;s Monster that spoke like a well educated 19th century gentleman. The book was so unlike what pop-culture had set me up to expect and I loved it for that. To be surprised by a story penned over two-centuries ago was a really great experience.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-adventures-of-amina-al-sirafi\">The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi</h1>\n<h2 id=\"by-sa-chakraborty\">by S.A.

To fail to suffer in silence and instead disrupt their lives and their fantasies of a compassionate society that coincidentally set them on top.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was a really fun book. It&rsquo;s my &ldquo;judge a book by its cover&rdquo; book - and I judged it to look cool. Like with <em>Between Two Fires,</em> this book appeals to a curious part of my interests that I can&rsquo;t explain - I&rsquo;m not a boat person, I haven&rsquo;t spent time at sea, I don&rsquo;t even really <em>want</em> to be on or around boats, but I <em>love</em> a sea-faring adventure. It&rsquo;s likely some combination of growing up watching Sinbad and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, but I&rsquo;m just drawn to stories about big ships and sea monsters or disasters at sea.</p>\n<p>And this one <em>delivers.</em> If I can critique the book at all, it&rsquo;s maybe that it&rsquo;s a bit long. It could definitely have used some trimming, but when its going, it&rsquo;s a real romp. The characters are super fun, the stakes are high, the setting and the plot are novel and unique. I&rsquo;ll definitely be reading more of these if there do end up being more in the series.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>And that&rsquo;s what I read this year. I&rsquo;m really happy to have passed my goal of one book per month - even if I did sometimes pass months reading very little. I didn&rsquo;t realize the themes of work, labour, Luddism and technology running through these books until I sat down to write this, but I guess it isn&rsquo;t surprising that these were the ideas I was drawn to, considering what&rsquo;s going on in the world and what I&rsquo;ve been thinking about.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m aiming for <em>more of the same</em> with my reading goals for next year. I&rsquo;m not upping the ante, instead hoping to again read at least one book a month and to maybe expand my horizons more on the perspectives and genres of what I read. I don&rsquo;t</p>",
