> I already wrote about why I left the company, but to sum up: the business changed and I didn’t like/support these changes, I wanted to reconnect with my community of art and illustration friends/colleagues, and I wanted to work on things that mattered to me. 

[Kyle Webster, *Hello, Procreate.*](https://accidental-expert.com/p/hello-procreate)

The discourse around Adobe recently has highlighted what I have been saying about artists being at odds with corporations. While Adobe’s recent PR messes are worth being upset about, I think it’s important we realize how small of a change it was — they were already so misaligned from the values and needs of most of the artists forced to use their tools.

It’s illuminating to hear that the company has shifted so much that it’s driving such important artists away. A boon for Procreate, but a real black mark on Adobe. What does it say about your culture and priorities when this is the reason people cite for leaving?

Adobe is such a perfect case study in how to squander a reputation and burn bridges. But more than that, they represent a lesson we should all take away as artists: don’t let yourself become dependant on tools or companies. Your power is in your ability to create — not to create with something.

Lastly, I just feel like we need to say this all the time: don’t take anything companies or CEOs say at face value. Adobe will always say they value artists because we are the only reason they exist — but what do their actions say?
