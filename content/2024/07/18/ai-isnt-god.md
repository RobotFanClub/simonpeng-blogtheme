A few weeks ago I published a piece about how [AI is showing up in everything, even Adobe Acrobat.](https://www.everyonescreative.net/p/ai-companies-think-youre-stupid) It’s now well beyond ridiculous, and the one thing I didn’t articulate with words but explored a bit with visuals is the absolutely hilarious way that AI is elevated to this omnipotent, god-like status -- it’s something so powerful and dangerous that we don’t understand how incredible it is -- but then we use it to do some of the most mundane, trivial shit. It’s like asking Jesus to put together your IKEA for you.

[People much smarter than me](https://emilygorcenski.com/post/making-god/) have pointed out how AI evangelists speak about “AGI” (Artificial *General* Intelligence) and technology in general with a fully religious fervour. It’s part of what is so off-putting about AI tools to me. Like Web3, crypto, NFTs and basically any other cyber-cult there’s this uncritical dogma circling AI that forces you to accept certain things as fact before you can even join the conversation. And I just don’t. It doesn’t follow, to me, that a sufficiently complex auto-complete text generator will somehow ascend toward full god-level intelligence. I don’t believe it. And because I don’t believe *that* everything that follows is just impossible to believe. 

Conversely, the people that *do* accept the dogma now have a solid logical framework for everything else to build off of. It makes perfect sense that every business will want to integrate AI into their products and their workflows -- who wouldn’t want a GOD on their side?

This is where the absurdity of the comparison slots into place for me. I just don’t get how we can ask god to do our homework for us. I don’t understand how it seems like a good use of a cyber-deity to summarize an email for you. It reminds me of when I watch Survivor and people are *praying to god* to save them from being voted out. Is that a good use of your god’s infinite, transcendent power and influence? To keep you on a game show?

Anyways, this whole rant was just meant to set up the rationale behind the images I made to go with that recent post. I discovered [these amazing prints on The Public Domain Review](https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/passio-verbigenae/) and when I thought of contrasting them with the meaningless word trash Adobe created to promote Acrobat AI, it felt too funny not to try it out.

I really love how lame the marketing language looks when you pair it with literal biblical imagery.

Working on *Everyone’s Creative* has been interesting in how it’s helped me widen what I let myself create for the newsletter. Before, when it was still *Robot Fan Club* it felt very closely tied to my identity as an illustrator. I felt a real pressure (from myself) to draw a lot of the imagery I used to support the writing. Sometimes it worked really well! Sometimes I was clearly less into it. With this new name and framing, though, I feel way more free to play with design, collage, typography and visual metaphor in a way that has been a lot of fun. The visual identity that is growing around *Everyone’s Creative* is really energizing me. 

I’m looking forward to experimenting more with the art I make for EC. It feels like a new “era” for my work and I feel so much more excited about making things recently than I have in a long time. Turns out I like novelty!
