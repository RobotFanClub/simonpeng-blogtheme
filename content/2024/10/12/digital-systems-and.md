> ...digital systems and tools should not be ceded to the market—we should not accept the assumption driven into our heads that their natural form and function is to be an instrument of capital, profit, surveillance, social control, and so on. AI and the internet (as much as these terms can describe a singular thing) are constituted by actors whose interests don’t align with our own, and incidental scenarios where we both eek out a benefit tend to be slanted in the direction of those firms spreading the infection

~ [Edward Ongweso Jr, _AI, life engineering, and digital hygiene_](https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/ai-life-engineering-and-digital-hygiene)

This is relevant to everyone, but _especially_ artists working online and with digital tools.

Every part of making things — from brainstorming to creating to sharing your work — is being commodified and offered for a monthly fee. And the more we depend on these systems and tools, the more things shift further into the domain of the capitalists and the tech evangelists.

This is why I’m becoming so much more sceptical of the idea that every new emerging technology is inevitable and needs to be embraced or you’ll fall behind. That idea so obviously benefits the people marketing tech and not the people using it or creating culture. We do have a say in it, too, you know?
