The more I think about how creativity really is the root to solving all our problems, the more I worry about how many people may not even try because of the systems that say nothing will work. We need to push back.

> nothing is impossible to try. Some systemic order telling you something isn't allowed or is impossible is fundamentally wrong. You can try to fly, draw, set fires with your mind, tell stories, make things better for others, invent something you've always dreamed ofâ€”you might not succeed, but you can always try.
