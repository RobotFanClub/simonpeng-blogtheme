*this page is a work-in-progress and probably always will be*

I like the idea of abolishing "secret recipes." When we share the tools we use, the methods we follow, and the resources we've had access to, we expand the communities we value and invite the same transparency from others. 

I believe deeply in **demystifying process.** I hope sharing the tools I use and the way I work will help empower others to make things themselves. 

At the same time, I believe we shouldn't elevate tools to aid gatekeeping. There's almost nothing that can *only* be accomplished in a single way, and so experimentation and flexibility are core to my approach, too. You should never feel you can't participate in something because you can't afford a tool or resource - especially in art making. The resources listed here are not essential to anything I do - I just like using them - the only essential piece is us.
