I'm Simon! I currently work in marketing, making brands (among many other things) for people and companies that want to speak to who they *really* are and what they *actually* believe -- not just marketing to boost sales at any cost. 

I'm a teacher at heart -- having taught graphic design and illustration at Mohawk College and now bringing an educator's perspective to all the work I do. 

My aim is to lift the veil on the creative process, to show people that there's really no such thing as "natural talent" and that artistic "geniuses" are really just good at hiding their mistakes.
