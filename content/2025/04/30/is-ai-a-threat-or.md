> AI will outpace humans in all structured tasks. If you’re producing repeatable deliverables, you will be automated.

- [Being in Space](https://open.substack.com/pub/beinginspace/p/ai-and-money)

I don’t disagree with this take, but I do wonder if anyone willingly finds themself in the “repeatable deliverables” situation of their own volition. 

I do a lot of the same things in my work, but over-optimizing a system and doing things exactly the same way every day becomes so boring and soulless. I’m constantly re-working how I arrive at a finished product and that in turn refines what I make (the quality and the process and experience of the making). 

Before factories and mass-production and Taylorism, things were much more freeform. Craftspeople built their own tools and constantly reimagined what they did. Art and “production” are only different when someone else is forcing you to produce repetitively and in a standardized way. That’s where you become replaceable: when you’re just a stand-in for a machine.

As with so many other issues, is AI showing us where we need to pivot in order to stay relevant or is it revealing to us where the exploitation and power structures already are in our society?
