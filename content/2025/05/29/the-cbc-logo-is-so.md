The CBC logo is so crazy iconic. Itâ€™s odd to feel patriotic about branding but Canadians have it pretty good in this regard. CBC, the (formerly public) CN Rail brand, the Canadian flag ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Thereâ€™s a lot of great design baked into our nation and thereâ€™s probably something to be said about how that used to bring us together.

Interesting that the worst design I saw from the big parties during the election was pretty clearly all from the conservatives, who are also the most polarizing and populist voice in our politics right now. Does good design tend to lean centre-left? Some of the most iconic poster design I can think of is explicitly communist.

Does bad design make people feel less united? I personally know I donâ€™t want to be identified with things that are just objectively ugly or incompetent.

Can design help heal the divide weâ€™re seeing politically around the world? I feel like thatâ€™s a big ask.
