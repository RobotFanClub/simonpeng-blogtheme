I have had to dip back into working with Adobe applications a bit, and am having the "pleasure" of using Microsoft Office programs to set up templates for clients. Both are amazing me with these little features I look for only to find out they're known issues with many years of people requesting them and the general response to the request is just "Unfortunately, that just doesn't exist :( Sorry!" 

Aren't these two of the biggest software companies on earth? It's almost like their primary interest *isn't* in making their tools better for the people that use them... ü§î
