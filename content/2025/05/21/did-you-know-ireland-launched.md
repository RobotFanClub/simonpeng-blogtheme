> Did you know Ireland launched a basic income pilot just for artists? €325/week for 3 years. Not charity—it's recognition that art is essential work.

[via Shagun Singh](https://substack.com/@shagunsingh/note/c-111837880?)

Imagine if we eliminated the middle-man and artists didn’t need to beg for money on Patreon and justify the (commercial) value of their work. 

We should all want to cultivate a rich culture. Arts funding should go hand-in-hand with science funding. We can’t say what the tangible benefits of space exploration or creative exploration will be but they both can yield results nobody could plan for.
