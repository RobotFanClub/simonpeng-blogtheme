As more and more people seem to be blindly accepting that AI belongs everywhere, whether it makes any sense or not, I think it‚Äôs important to demystify AI more and talk about the people trying to push for this future. Who does it actually benefit? What do they value? Why are we just going along with it?

This is a great interview and a very revealing conversation about the company behind some of the most popular AI products today. If you use AI tools, you should understand where (and who) they come from before you make them an indispensable part of how you work and think.
